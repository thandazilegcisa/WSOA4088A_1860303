          In the history of games studies, game mechanics are thought of as a
          key factor in establishing the relation between the rules and the
          challenges of the system. Understanding this distinction is important
          because according to Sicart (2008) research on games as systems leads
          to a formal analysis of the game components and how they interrelate.
          This paper will attempt to define games and address what constitutes a
          game, why, and how gameful experiences can be materialised or engaged
          with in relation to the mechanics or rules defined by a system. This
          will serve to define and situate what gamification means in relation
          to my research context – Surveys. Therefore, the objective of this
          paper and my practical component is to propose gamification as a
          service to make surveys more pleasant to fill and consequently improve
          the quality of survey performance by evoking the positive or negative
          experiences and motivations that games do.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          The first section of this paper sets out to describe the methodologies
          practiced while conducting research. The second section defines and
          discusses games and then uses the definitions to reflect on how
          something be it a classroom, workplace environment, product, or in our
          case study Surveys can be gamified in section three. Section four
          reflects on these definitions and relates them to my project. And
          lastly section five concludes the document.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          1. Methodology The methodology adopted for this research project is
          largely based on the collection of secondary data, which has guided
          both my understanding of my research as practice and theory. Hence,
          the foundation of both the practical, theoretical component stems from
          seeking to define and establish the meaning of Games, and
          Gamification. For example, I have used the MDA framework throughout
          the process of making my prototype and defining games in the following
          section along with game studies literature that I will use.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          2. Defining Games: The MDA framework is a widely used game design
          framework that assists designers/developers in understanding the
          relationship between the system and the agency that it provides to
          describe gameful experiences that encapsulate desirable emotional
          responses evoked by the player when they interact with a game system.
          However, throughout history, the main challenge faced by many
          researchers in establishing the significance of rules in relation to
          mechanics.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Previous definitions include understanding mechanics as a rule-based
          system that facilitate and encourage a user to explore and learn the
          properties of their possibility space using feedback mechanisms”
          (Sicart 2008). And as “a particular set of rules available to the
          player in the form of prescribed causal relations between game
          elements and their consequence to particular game states” (Sicart
          2008).
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          The interesting thing about these definitions is that they introduce
          the idea that a game is nothing without a player and that the player
          must be realised and sometimes embodied through the design of the
          system. Therefore, important to the discussion of games is constraints
          and the constraints, be it semantically through the environment or the
          different game states that a game exhibits. Therefore, game mechanics
          can be understood as methods invoked by agents (the player), to
          subsequently interact with the rules to change the conditions of a
          game state (Sicart 2008).
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Hence, “game mechanics are concerned with the actual interaction with
          the game state, while rules provide the possibility space where that
          interaction is possible and thereby regulate the transition between
          states e.g., having Hp in a game is a mechanic, however, the rule
          would be how many lives or health points a player has in a specific
          game state. Rules, therefore, affect the runtime behaviour of how the
          mechanics are contextualised. In other words, mechanics to my
          understanding are affordances provided by a system, whereas rules are
          constraints that constitute the various challenges that can be solved
          using the mechanics of a system.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Sicart (2008) also presents a definition that signifies the systems
          that make up a game. He contextualises this argument using an
          object-orientated framework from which mechanics are programmed in a
          system to signify behaviour. I find this very interesting because this
          has guided much of how I went about programming the technical side of
          the project, I mainly used what he describes as object orientated
          programming. According to Sicart (2008) “following object-orientated
          programming terminology, a method is understood as the actions or
          behaviours available to a class. And methods are essentially the
          mechanisms an object has for accessing data within another object”.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Above is an example of object-orientated programming. This object is
          defined by a class named Player and stores data including the x, and y
          positions of the square, the size, and the colour. Additionally, this
          class object also stores methods which are functions that are
          properties of the player class object like the jump function which is
          something that only the player object property can do. Thus, the jump
          method is a mechanic because as defined by Sicart (2008) “game
          mechanics are methods invoked by agents for interacting with the game
          world”. This reflects the point of view undertaken in pursuit to
          gamify a survey. I mainly focused on using the definition of games and
          mechanics to establish how I approach gamifying a survey, therefore
          much of the project explores gamification from a systems point of view
          instead of from a service perspective, which brings me to the
          following:
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          3. Defining Gamification: Gamification has grown into becoming a
          largely contested term since its first introduction in 2008. However,
          there is evidence that gamification plays a crucial role in designing
          for motivation in a non-gaming context, products, and services
          (Deterding 2012). Therefore, in its earlier conception gamification
          has become synonymous with rewards. Hence, most early adopters of
          gamification systems tended to focus on adding points, levels, leader
          boards, achievements, or badges to a real-world setting to entice
          people to engage with a product or service.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          However, researchers argue that reward-based gamification “takes the
          least essential element in games and represents it as the core of the
          experience” (Deterding 2012). This contends that the pleasures of
          games arise not from a feedback system such as rewards, but meaningful
          choices (Deterding 2012). This is significant because Nicholson (2011)
          reiterates this idea by contextualising the use of gamification in
          relation to the type of goals set out to be achieved. He distinguishes
          the contextual needs for inspiring short-term, and long-term goals.
          Thus, in establishing this difference I would argue that feedback
          systems often aim to signify the achievement of short-term goals of a
          player.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Therefore, long-term goals often aim to intrinsically motivate players
          to make meaningful decisions by providing gameful experiences. What
          are gameful experiences? Well since games today often take upwards of
          15 hours to complete. Some long-term transformations or processes take
          place as the player learns how to control the system and actively
          define their experience within the game. As a result, mechanics in the
          long term do not become a heavy cognitive load, instead, the game
          experience comes to the fore. Therefore, from this, I would argue that
          a gameful experience mostly speaks to the dynamic, aesthetic qualities
          that games employ, such as enjoyment, challenge, sensation, narrative,
          affect, unintended consequences, and flow – to name a few.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Deterding et al (2008) define gamification as the use of game design
          elements in non-game contexts. We have already discussed some of those
          elements, some of which take the form of reward-based, feedback
          systems. Although, my focus for the project was to establish a
          mechanical foundation from which I can understand and subsequently
          implement gamification. And in that respect, although jumping and
          running are not specific to games, it is characteristic to games in
          the context of a jump and run infinite scroller and consequently,
          these are elements that are found in most games, including more
          specifically infinite runners or platformers. Therefore, the basis
          from which I have approached to gamify surveys is from a systems
          perspective, more specifically mechanics.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Therefore, my practical component emphasises a systematic
          understanding of gamification, instead of the experiential nature of
          games. Hence, the component does not aim to understand the value
          creation in services. Therefore, according to Houtari and Hamari’s
          (2010) definition, my practical component does not build business
          intelligence. However, my practical component can be viewed as part of
          the overall service of surveys and how it supports the core service
          offering, which is to provide a challenging or gameful experience for
          the player.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          4. Gamification of Online Surveys In my own experience, though surveys
          are an important means of data collection in research and marketing,
          they are often dull and unengaging. Therefore, for this project I have
          proposed gamification as means to make online surveys more pleasant to
          fill and consequently, to improve the quality of surveys using
          providing motivational affordances using game mechanics. According to
          Harms et al (2015), this effective behaviour towards surveys drives
          “negative respondent behaviour such as speeding, random responding,
          premature, and lack of attention”. However, upon inspection “gamified
          surveys have reported diverse benefits regarding user experience,
          motivation, participation, amount and quality of data.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          As mentioned before, my practical component predominantly focuses on
          the systems perspective of gamification rather than service or
          business intelligence, therefore there are no clear target user groups
          determined for the process. Although, the practical component focuses
          on mechanics, because of the nature of infinite runner games, inciting
          challenges as motivational means of engaging with the system was the
          intended goal for the aesthetics. For the sake of this paper, I will
          detail and reflect on the decisions I took in deciding how the
          challenge has or can be further implemented and how its implementation
          will affect the quality or randomness of responses.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          The MDA framework defines dynamics as “the run-time behaviour of a
          system”. So, dynamics imply change, how a user’s actions affect the
          overall state of gameplay. Therefore, to communicate the completion of
          a flow of interactions I have created a feedback loop in the vein of a
          progress bar. This is the only feedback mechanism I have incorporated
          into the project, mainly because a progress bar fits the context that
          I am working in – Surveys.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Conclusion & Breakdown According to Wyss et al (2019), a study showed
          that adding game elements to surveys results in the enhancement of
          respondent’s experience, making it a more enjoyable process.
          Therefore, gamification is a way of improving user experience and
          increasing engagement in online surveys using game/ game design
          elements. Hence, this work documents the application of a proposed
          design process and describes the resulting design. My future work in
          this area could benefit from approaching gamification from the
          perspective of Hutotari and Hamari (2012) of gamification as “a
          process of providing affordances for gameful experiences with support
          the customer's overall value creation”. • Practical Component – 40% •
