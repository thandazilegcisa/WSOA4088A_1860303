          <h1 class="header-One">Why Gamification is Bullshit?</h1>
        </header>
        <p class="header-Text">
          In the paper of the above title, Ian Bogost examines and explores why
          gamification is bullshit, thus this paper seeks to reflect on the said
          reading by evaluating the propositions posed by Ian Bogost. Bogost
          makes it clear that what he means by “bullshit” is not derogatory.
          Instead, through it he merely suggests that “gamification is a primary
          practice of marketers and consultants who seek to construct and
          exploit an opportunity for benefit”(Bogost 2011).
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Exploitation is an important term to note to help understand how he
          rations “bullshit”. Because he writes that, “bullshit is a coercive
          strategy rather than one that has anything to do with the true value
          or promise of something”. He continues by providing context to his
          argument, by situating the ‘gamifier’ as a consultant. And identifies
          the consultant as a “bullshitter” that promotes the uses of
          gamification as an attempt to appeal to business as how executives can
          bolster or improve a company’s business model. The premise of Bogost’s
          argument is that gamification designers “bullshit” business executives
          into believing that gamification is a solution for achieving their
          goals.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          It is for this reason that Bogost suggests that gamification is the
          goal of gamification. And what I understand from this point is that he
          identifies and positions gamification consultants as designers of a
          persuasive game. In his 2007 book titled “Persuasive Games: The
          Expressive Power of Videogames”. Ian Bogost defines persuasive games
          as “those that aim to change or improve the attitudes of its players”.
          From this definition, we can deduce that he cites the persuasive
          acumen of consultants as a gamified business model sold to businesses
          to satisfy a company’s desire to claim that it has a gamification
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          As such during the past decade theories on and about gamification have
          become increasingly popular and have ultimately expanded into areas
          beyond the usual scope of earlier uses of points, leaderboards, and
          badges. Therefore, considering the early uses of gamification, Bogost
          notes that consultants “bullshit’ businesses by using similar or often
          the same gamification strategy across the concerned companies. And
          suggests that the use of points, leader boards and badges contribute
          to the “bullshitting” of businesses. As a result such gamification
          strategies do not consider the business model of business, because
          they do not provide any rationale behind the solution instead such
          strategies “assume that the fundamentals of a business including their
          business model, is sound”. And employees just need to be coerced into
          performing. For this reason, I agree with Bogost’s statement because
          such gamification strategies deliver short-term results. Results
          indicate and improve on the empirical performance of the business
          entity and not the individual.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          However, during the latter period of the past, last decade theories
          such as meaningful gamification have come into the conversation.
          Talking points include how gamification can be designed to bolster
          meaningful intrinsic motivation. Thus, intrinsic motivation
          prioritises the individual and their experiences. Therefore,
          bolstering intrinsic motivation would mean that the success of
          gamified solutions cannot be quantified by the empirical evidence of
          the businesses’ performance. Instead, they should be quantified by the
          qualitative evidence of the space, or ‘virtual space’ provided by
          gamification. And how the employees' experience and function within
          the space. To end up as intrinsically motivated employees.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Therefore, I am not completely of the opinion that gamification is
          “bullshit” but agree that gamification is bullshit because as explored
          in my previous literature review consultants may simply be trying to
          replicate the ‘aura’ of games for additional exhibition value.
          Therefore, “bullshit” is the result of the fact that designers were
          previously persuading businesses to adopt gamification practices for
          the wrong reasons, as outlined above.
