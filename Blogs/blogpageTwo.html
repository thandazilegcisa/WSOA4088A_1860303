        </header>
        <p class="header-Text">
          In the article of the above title, authour Scott Nicholson proposes
          and examines the different ways designers can employ gamification
          within their processes. Be it for serious or persuasive reasons.
          According to Nicholson (2015) the recipe for meaningful gamification
          is characterised by the following concepts: a.) Play b.) Exposition
          c.) Choice d.) Information e.) Engagement, and f.) Reflection.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          This study provides new insights into how gamification is to be
          understood. Written in 2015, Nicholson suggests that there is a
          proliferation of new ways gamification can be applied. In it he
          contests that “Meaningful gamification is the use of ‘gameful’ and
          playful elements to assist the user in finding personal connections
          that motivate engagement”. Throughout the article Nicholson
          prioritises or privileges the user rather than the designer in
          understanding what gamification is. How does he do this? He suggests
          that rather than acting upon something for an external reward which
          would be determined by a designer. A user should have intrinsic
          motivation to act upon something – What does this mean? It means that
          a user has their personal motivation for completing or acting upon
          something, be it for mastery, autonomy, or relatedness.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          From this we can infer that using game design elements to help build
          intrinsic motivation in a non-game setting is known as meaningful
          gamification (Nicholson, 2015). Thus, this can be reinforced as
          mentioned by mastery, which refers to when users learn something to
          the point of feeling confident in their ability. Secondly by autonomy,
          which refers to the agency provided to participants in carving out
          their own path. And lastly through relating with someone or something
          such as an NPC for example.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Subsequently if these three principles are met, according to Nicholson
          (2015) meaning can be achieved. As such a designer of a meaningful
          gamification system would have to afford users with a variety of ways
          of experiencing a gamified system, so that each user can find
          something meaningful that pertains to their intrinsic motivation.
          Therefore, one gamified system would need to benefit multiple users
          with the ability to learn, relate, have agency and demonstrate mastery
          of the system (Nicholson, 2015).
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          For the purpose of this review, I will only substantiate Nicholson’s
          characteristic of play and choice. This is because how he infers to
          each becomes very important to how he concludes his research. He
          describes that in the advent of play or ‘playfulness’. A player is
          free to explore the boundless affordances or limitations granted by a
          gamified system. Although, it is important to mention that play must
          be optional, which is why play relates to the concept of choice.
          Therefore, from this ‘play-based’ perspective players should be able
          to choose to create and change their own constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          By giving the player choice, the system positions the player in
          control and provides the player with the agency to function within a
          system created by their own mastery or limitations to create a playful
          experience. That being said what has become important to note is how
          the article illustrates the difference between how gamification is
          inscribed in a non-game context versus how it is embodied through a
          non-game context. The former being inscribed by designers. And latter
          by users. All of which represent or outline a call to move away from
          reward-based gamification for long-term change, because according to
          Nicholson (2015) For true long-term change to occur the gamified
          system needs to be designed as a journey, made to be and come to an
          end for the individual user.
