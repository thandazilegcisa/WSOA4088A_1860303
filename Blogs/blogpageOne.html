        <p class="header-Text">
          According to (Deterding 2016) the term gamification began being
          conceptualised in the year 2008. Since then, the proliferation of
          “gamified” media has led researchers to describe “gamification” in
          relation to the adoption of game design elements outside the gaming
          industry. Although much contestation around the term has largely been
          rather controversial, as there is no previous agreement about what
          gamification is. Hence, the abundance of published research in game
          studies and proliferation of user experience designers as a profession
          has resulted in referring to gamification as using interactive
          technologies and game design principles to improve audience and
          employee participation and engagement.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Hence, to my discretion, how gamification has been referred to and
          thought of, is that it would embody the ‘aura’ and culture of a
          product. And that not only would users exhibit value in the product
          itself, but the phenomenological experience gained from the use. I
          refer to this because several researchers have examined “playfulness
          as a desirable user experience or mode of interaction and how to
          design for it”. In the field of game studies, “gamification” can be
          seen through the lens of serious and persuasive games that entangles
          the game experience with real-life – the personal body instead of a
          fictional body.

        <p class="header-Text">
          However, mediums outside games such as film, animation, news, reality
          tv, and music often describe gamification about the process of using
          game design modes – UI interactions, design principles, and elements.
          And integrating ‘gamified’ modes of representation into the broader
          extensions of the provisions of digital technology in the form of
          e-commerce, health, education services, and interactive art.
          Gamification and its integration in the practice and mastery of art
          particularly interested me. And upon reading the literature, it relied
          heavily on theory and theoretical research which thus did not produce
          an ample sum of examples to infer to, therefore, the question that
          kept on continuously ravaging my mind Is whether gamification is
          synonymous with intermediality?
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Deterding et al (2016) begins’ by defining the term gamification
          through a series of sub-sections detailing what is meant by a game, a
          game element, and non-game context. That is important because by
          defining what a game means I was able to promptly differentiate
          between gamification and intermediality. Intermediality refers to
          something that mixes modes and mediums to create something new. It is
          a way of understanding the relations or transgressions between two
          media. It is for this reason that I fell into probably the same
          misconceptions that people outside the gaming industry may have.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Therefore, to elaborate on this distinction, I will use a recent
          (2021) Rick and Morty special episode. Rick and Morty is an Adult Swim
          animation series and mentioning this is important because of the
          medium Rick and Morty represents itself in (animation). In this
          special episode, Rick and Morty utilises’ videogame modes such as
          pixel graphics, parallax two-dimensional scrolling, boss fights, and
          Morty as an upgradable weapon system throughout their adventure. All
          of which fit the description of intermediality, although does it do
          the same for gamification?
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Well according to (Deterding et al 2016) contrasting and comparing
          games and play with the help of Caillois's concept of paidia and ludus
          is extremely important to understanding gamification. Because paidia
          (‘playing’) refers to a free form and expressive improvisational
          combination of behaviours and Ludus meaning (‘gaming’) structured by
          rules and strife towards goals. Therefore with this definition in mind
          and considering our Rick and Morty case study I can conclude that what
          distinguishes transmediality and gamification is that although Rick
          and Morty uses elements that are characteristic to games and play a
          significant role in gameplay, the very fact that Rick and Morty are
          represented as an animation series mostly resembles play, because the
          animators are the people who had free expression over the medium and
          not the viewer (Deterding et al 2016) states videogames unlike any
          other medium actively provides a point of interaction for users to
          infer their meaning towards. As such intermediality should not be
          construed with gamification because the subject would have to fit the
          definition of a game as a result.
        </p>
        <p class="header-Text">
          Therefore, to say something is gamified, we would have to begin by
          defining a game and consider how they are designed. Thus, to determine
          if a subject has been gamified one would have to distinguish the
          interface design patterns, mechanics, conceptual modes, and general
          design principles used to structure games and consider whether the
          subject in question is created and developed with the intention of a
          system that includes the Ludus elements of gaming.
